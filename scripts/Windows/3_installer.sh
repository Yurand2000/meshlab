# This is a powershell script for computing an installer for MeshLab.
# Requires:
# - a properly deployed meshlab (see 1_deploy.sh);
# - the env variable PATH containing the NSIS folder (makensis.exe must be directly accessible)
#
# Without given arguments, the folder that will be deployed is meshlab/install.
#
# You can give as argument the INSTALL_PATH.
#
# After running this script, the installer can be found inside the install folder.
